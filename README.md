# Summoning Stone â€“ Desktop App

**WoW Addon can be found here:** https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/summoning-stone

**Android application still under development. If you'd like to be a tester, please join the google group to get access: https://groups.google.com/u/2/g/summoning-stone-android**

**Summoning Stone** is a desktop application built with Electron. It monitors the World of Warcraft screenshot directory for new screenshots and sends a UDP notification to an Android device running the Summoning Stone Android app or the local web server. It is only functional when used alongside the Summoning Stone World of Warcraft addon.

## Setup Options

### Option 1: Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/soupdeloup/summoning-stone.git
cd summoning_stone
npm install
```

### Once installed, start through command line:

```bash
npm start
```

### Optionally, you can build an executable instead of using the command line:

```bash
npm run build
```

This uses `electron-builder` to generate a standalone executable in the `dist` folder.

### Option 2: Download the standalone executable from the 'Releases' section of this Github page

*Please note* that the exe is unsigned, which means that you'll probably get Microsoft/anti-virus popups saying the app developer is unknown and that the app may be unsafe. You can ignore these warnings and run application, or you can use option 1 to copy and run the code yourself.

## Usage

- The app will try to detect the default WoW screenshot path. If not found, you can manually set it.
- If using the android application, it must be connected to the same local network and will be auto-detected by the desktop application.
- If not using the android application, a local web server will be created that you can browse to using any device on the same network.
- You can change between using the android application, web server or both in settings.
